# wallclock

This is a program that shows a graphical analog wall clock of current time. I created this program when I find interesting about creating graphics through c programming language.

Drawbacks of this program
1. It uses a graphic header file that is only runnable through Turbo C++ software. I am currently learning OpenGL so that I can reproduce the output in todays mordern IDE and can able to run in linux environment also.
2. It is designed to run for 70 sec and it can modified only by entering in the code.
